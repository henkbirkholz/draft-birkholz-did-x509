1.  Introduction

   This document aims to define an interoperable and flexible issuer
   identifier format for COSE messages that transport or refer to X.509
   certificates using [RFC9360].  The did:x509 identifier format
   implements a direct, resolvable binding between a certificate chain
   and a compact issuer string.  It can be used in a COSE Header CWT
   Claims map as defined in [RFC9597].  This issuer identifier is
   convenient for references and policy evaluation, for example in the
   context of transparency ledgers.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, CDDL [RFC8610] [RFC9165] is used to describe the
   data formats.

   The reader is assumed to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts
   defined in [I-D.ietf-scitt-architechture].

3.  CDDL for a JSON Data Model for X.509 Certification Paths

CertificateChain = [2*Certificate]  ; leaf is first

Certificate = {
    fingerprint: {
        ; base64url-encoded hashes of the DER-encoded certificate
        sha256: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-256
        sha384: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-384
        sha512: base64url      ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-512
    },
    issuer: Name,              ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.4
    subject: Name,             ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.6
    extensions: {
        ? eku: [+OID],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.12
        ? san: [+SAN],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.6
        ? fulcio_issuer: tstr  ; http://oid-info.com/get/1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1
    }
}

; X.509 Name as an object of attributes
; Repeated attribute types are not supported
; Common attribute types have human-readable labels (see below)
; Other attribute types use dotted OIDs
; Values are converted to UTF-8
Name = {
    ; See RFC 4514, Section 3, for meaning of common attribute types
    ? CN: tstr,
    ? L: tstr,
    ? ST: tstr,
    ? O: tstr,
    ? OU: tstr,
    ? C: tstr,
    ? STREET: tstr,
    * OID => tstr
}

; base64url-encoded data, see RFC 4648, Section 5
base64url = tstr

; ASN.1 Object Identifier
; Dotted string, for example "1.2.3"
OID = tstr

; X.509 Subject Alternative Name
; Strings are converted to UTF-8
SAN = rfc822Name / DNSName / URI / DirectoryName
rfc822Name = ["email", tstr] ; Example: ["email", "bill@microsoft.com"]
DNSName = ["dns", tstr]      ; Example: ["dns", "microsoft.com"]
URI = ["uri", tstr]          ; Example: ["uri", "https://microsoft.com"]
DirectoryName = ["dn", Name] ; Example: ["dn", {CN: "Microsoft"}]
