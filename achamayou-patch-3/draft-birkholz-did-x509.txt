3.  CDDL for a JSON Data Model for X.509 Certification Paths

CertificateChain = [2*Certificate]  ; leaf is first

Certificate = {
    fingerprint: {
        ; base64url-encoded hashes of the DER-encoded certificate
        sha256: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-256
        sha384: base64url,     ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-384
        sha512: base64url      ; FIPS 180-4, SHA-512
    },
    issuer: Name,              ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.4
    subject: Name,             ; RFC 5280, Section 4.1.2.6
    extensions: {
        ? eku: [+OID],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.12
        ? san: [+SAN],         ; RFC 5280, Section 4.2.1.6
        ? fulcio_issuer: tstr  ; http://oid-info.com/get/1.3.6.1.4.1.57264.1.1
    }
}

; X.509 Name as an object of attributes
; Repeated attribute types are not supported
; Common attribute types have human-readable labels (see below)
; Other attribute types use dotted OIDs
; Values are converted to UTF-8
Name = {
    ; See RFC 4514, Section 3, for meaning of common attribute types
    ? CN: tstr,
    ? L: tstr,
    ? ST: tstr,
    ? O: tstr,
    ? OU: tstr,
    ? C: tstr,
    ? STREET: tstr,
    * OID => tstr
}

; base64url-encoded data, see RFC 4648, Section 5
base64url = tstr

; ASN.1 Object Identifier
; Dotted string, for example "1.2.3"
OID = tstr

; X.509 Subject Alternative Name
; Strings are converted to UTF-8
SAN = rfc822Name / DNSName / URI / DirectoryName
rfc822Name = ["email", tstr] ; Example: ["email", "bill@microsoft.com"]
DNSName = ["dns", tstr]      ; Example: ["dns", "microsoft.com"]
URI = ["uri", tstr]          ; Example: ["uri", "https://microsoft.com"]
DirectoryName = ["dn", Name] ; Example: ["dn", {CN: "Microsoft"}]

4.  Privacy Considerations

   Some considerations

5.  Security Consideration

5.1.  Identifier ambiguity

   This DID method maps characteristics of X.509 certificate chains to
   identifiers.  It allows a single identifier to map to multiple
   certificate chains, giving the identifier stability across the expiry
   of individual chains.  However, if the policies used in the
   identifier are chosen too loosely, the identifier may match too wide
   a set of certificate chains.  This may have security implications as
   it may authorize an identity for actions it was not meant to be
   authorized for.

   To mitigate this issue, the certificate authority should publish
   their expected usage of certificate fields and indicate which ones
   constitute a unique identity, versus any additional fields that may
   be of an informational nature.  This will help users create an
   appropriate did:x509 as well as consumers of signed content to decide
   whether it is appropriate to trust a given did:x509.

5.1.1.  X.509 trust stores

   Typically, a verifier trusts an X.509 certificate by applying chain
   validation defined in Section 6 of [RFC5280] using a set of
   certificate authority (CA) certificates as trust store, together with
   additional application-specific policies.

   This DID method does not require an X.509 trust anchor store but
   rather relies on verifiers either trusting an individual DID directly
   or using third-party endorsements for a given DID, like [VC], to
   establish trust.

   By layering this DID method on top of X.509, verifiers are free to
   use traditional chain validation (for example, verifiers unaware of
   DID), or rely on DID as an ecosystem to establish trust.

6.  IANA Considerations
